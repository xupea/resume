# Introduction

Hi, I'm Peter, and I graduated from Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou in 2008. 
I love to create beautiful and performant products with delightful user experiences.
So that's why I chose front end engineering as my career.

For now, I have been working on front end development for 14 years and led teams for 4 years, I still enjoy it.

and what i learned most is 

dealing with problems with different ways

thinking problem with multiple hats

currently I'm working on the translation of a framework called testing-libraray in github, which is DE facto standard library for component testing.

I love knowlege sharing, so recently i start writing blogs in juejin. 

# Weakness

I multitask too much. I first noticed it was an issue in my last job - 
I was too distracted and tackling two or three tasks at once ruined my productivity. 
Iâ€™ve been minding how I work ever since and I make sure to always define and prioritize all my tasks. 
Then, instead of juggling 3 at the same time, I try to go through them one by one
